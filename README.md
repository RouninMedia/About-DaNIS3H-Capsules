# DaNIS³H Capsules

**DaNIS³H** is a **JSON**-based concept technology which takes advantage of a _meta-programming_ approach which can be described as **Code as Data**.

**DaNIS³H** rewrites all core front-end technologies (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and SVG) as **JSON** and outputs library-less components intended to be easily:

 - discoverable
 - shareable
 - moddable
 - extendable
 - versionable

**DaNIS³H** stands for **Data and Namespaced Importable Scripts, Styles, SVG & HTML**.
